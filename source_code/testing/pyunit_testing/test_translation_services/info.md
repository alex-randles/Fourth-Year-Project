#  USER TESTING

This test is testing which python speech-to-text service is most reliable and 
outputs the translation text the fastest. 

The translation services I will be testing are:
  *Recognition Services
	-Google Speech Recognition
	-CMU Sphinx
	* Houndify API
	* IBM Speech-to-text 
	* Microsoft bing voice recognition 
	
I asked 3 people to speak into my device from the same position 
saying the phrase "this is my project testing" and then I saved 
them as a .wav file. 

I then ran my testing script which would calculate the accuracy based 
on the number of words correctly translated divided by the total number of words. 
It also timed how long it took to output it's result. 

## Results 

All results are stored in the result.md file in this directory.
